Advent Of Code 2019 - Assembly
==============================

The advent of code is a yearly advent calender that, instead of containing chocolate or
prizes, contains small puzzles to be solved using a programming language of choice. This
repositories contains my solutions for the year 2019. For more information about the advent
calender and the puzzles, please visit https://adventofcode.com.

This is a project in which I try to port my correct solution, coded in Java, to a solution
writing in raw assembly. To build tools consists of NASM as a compiler and gcc as a linker.
